What the software does:
Takes user's name and age and displays back the user's name and their age in a sentence. 

How to use it: 
1. Make sure you have JupyterHub downloaded. Then, you can download our Notebook.ipynb file and open it in JupterHub and start editing it there. 
2. Run the code to see what it does. Then, you can make your own changes as you desire. 

License and Use:
To contribute to our project, first make sure you are following our code of conduct. Then, you can submit a pull request to collaborate. 

We chose this license because we want to share our program with others and provide a foundation, without any charge. In writing the license, we thought about making it clear and concise so that it's easy to understand and has no room for confusion. 

The license can be installed for free in any software and it prohibits people from selling the codes.
The code of conduct aligns with our values such as it states that people should respect others. It list behaviors that are not accepted.
